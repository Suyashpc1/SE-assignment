# Log Monitoring Script - Assignment 2

## 📄 Description
This project is a basic log monitoring shell script created as part of **Software Engineering Assignment 2**. It checks the system logs for any entries containing the keywords `error`, `failed`, or `critical`, and logs the findings into a file called `monitor.log`.

## 📁 Files Included
- `log_monitor.sh` – The main shell script that performs log monitoring.
- `monitor.log` – A sample output file generated by the script.
- `DFD_Level_1.png` – Data Flow Diagram (Level 1).
- `DFD_Level_2.png` – Data Flow Diagram (Level 2).
- `README.md` – This readme file.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The script uses `wevtutil` (Windows Event Viewer Utility) to query the latest 10 system log entries.
2. It filters out entries that contain any of the following (case-insensitive): `error`, `failed`, or `critical`.
3. If any are found, they are saved to `monitor.log` with a timestamp.
4. If not, it records "No critical errors found" with a timestamp.

## 🧪 Sample Output
Here is an example of what `monitor.log` might contain:

```
Tue Apr  8 19:00:00 IST 2025 - No critical errors found
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Git Bash and navigate to the directory where `log_monitor.sh` is saved.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x log_monitor.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./log_monitor.sh
   ```
